# Golang Concurrency Project

## Get PrimeNumbers using concurrency

Project that utilises golang concurrency.
Find the number of primenumbers between **1 and 1000000**
using **goroutines**

## Getting Started

- Clone repo `git clone https://github.com/go-concurrency`
- run `go run main.go` inside dir

## Considerations

- You can change limit of primenumbers or the number of goroutines from

  ```
  func main() {
  limit := 1000000
  numWorkers := 10
  .....
  ```
